# Uniswap-Clone
Minimalistic Uniswap Clone Transaction Tracker

This is the begining of Git and Web 3.0 for me.

Aim of this Project is to make transaction on Web3 and record them in the Database based on User Accounts

This App contains a minimalistic coding of Uniswap

Uniswap --> Actually Uniswap is a site for Decentralized Crypto Exchange like you give Eth  and get Equaliant DAI

But Here is  the clone for just send the transaction

Like you give the Account Number and Amount of Eth  to be Send then get transfeered to respective account on one click

Entirely First-End is Developed using Javascript with TailWind CSS

Finally,For DataBase Sanity.io will be used.
